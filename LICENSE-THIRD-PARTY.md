# Third-party licences

## obsidian-footnotes

Two things come from
[`obsidian-footnotes`](https://github.com/Comprehensive-Jason/obsidian-footnotes),
both contributed for this purpose.

`test/parity/corpus-hunt.ts` holds structural markdown fixtures harvested from that
project's `test/hunt/` regression pins. They cover block-structure edges a generated
corpus does not reach.

`test/parity/referee-answers/` is its `test/obsidian-answers/` directory vendored
verbatim — 6,818 documents with the `metadataCache` answers real Obsidian gave for
each. This IS that project's recorded measurement, not just its inputs, and it is
what `referee.mts` and eight sibling instruments compare against. Kept
byte-identical (see `.prettierignore`) so a diff against upstream shows answers
changing and nothing else. The only local change is that `refsTrustworthy` is
populated where upstream leaves it `null`, written by `recorder.mts`.

None of that is published to npm; `package.json` ships `dist` only.

A third thing IS published. `src/rp8/reader.ts`, the `legacy` preset's parser, ports the
Obsidian readers of that project's `src/parsing/obsidian-markdown.ts` -- `%%` comments, callout
titles, table pipe styles, wikilinks, frontmatter, `$$` inline math -- and `src/rp8/list.ts`
follows its `remark-parse-list.js` in changing remark-parse 8's list reader. Both are bundled
into `dist`, under this licence.

## micromark-extension-math

`src/lib/syntax/math-text.ts` is adapted from
[`micromark-extension-math`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-math).
Its tokenizer and resolver were vendored so Obsidian's inline-math rules could be
implemented directly; see the file header for the specific divergences.

## micromark-extension-gfm-footnote

`src/lib/syntax/footnote.ts` is vendored from
[`micromark-extension-gfm-footnote`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-footnote)
2.1.0, the footnote syntax `remark-gfm` registers. `strict` uses it in place of upstream's with
Obsidian's label rule -- a `[` may sit inside a label and a backslash escapes nothing; the file
header has the details.

## remark-parse 8 and its companions

`src/rp8/vendor/` vendors remark-parse 8.0.3, remark-footnotes 2.0.0, remark-math 3.0.1 and
parse-entities 2.0.0 with the v1 entity tables, converted to ESM; `src/rp8/vendor/helpers.ts`
rewrites the small packages they required (trim, repeat-string, xtend, is-whitespace-character,
is-word-character, is-decimal, is-alphabetical, is-hexadecimal, is-alphanumerical,
trim-trailing-lines, collapse-white-space, ccount, state-toggle, markdown-escapes, vfile-location,
unist-util-remove-position). `src/rp8/list.ts` and `src/rp8/remove-indentation.ts` are
remark-parse 8 files with Obsidian's changes. All are bundled into `dist`. Each is MIT:

- remark-parse 8.0.3 -- Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>;
  Copyright (c) 2011-2014, Christopher Jeffrey (https://github.com/chjj/)
- remark-footnotes 2.0.0 -- Copyright (c) 2020 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- remark-math 3.0.1 -- Junyoung Choi <fluke8259@gmail.com> (its `package.json`; the published
  tarball carries no licence file)
- parse-entities 2.0.0 -- Copyright (c) 2015 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- character-entities 1.2.4, character-entities-legacy 1.1.4, character-reference-invalid 1.1.4
  -- Copyright (c) 2015 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- the helper packages above: vfile-location, state-toggle, ccount, markdown-escapes and the
  is-* predicates follow Titus Wormer's MIT sources closely; trim, repeat-string and xtend are
  replaced by `String.prototype.trim`, `String.prototype.repeat` and a plain property copy, so
  no code of theirs is included

## npm packages bundled into `dist`

esbuild bundles these from `node_modules` into `dist/index.js`, at the versions
`package-lock.json` pins. They are separate from the vendored `character-entities` 1.x and
`micromark-extension-math` source above: `dist` holds both. Each is MIT:

- `character-entities`, `character-entities-legacy`, `fault`, `mdast-util-to-string`,
  `unist-util-is`, `unist-util-visit` -- Copyright (c) 2015 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- `longest-streak` -- Copyright (c) 2015 Titus Wormer <mailto:tituswormer@gmail.com>
- `unist-util-visit-parents` -- Copyright (c) 2016 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- `mdast-util-frontmatter`, `mdast-util-math`, `micromark-extension-frontmatter`,
  `micromark-extension-math` -- Copyright (c) 2020 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- `devlop` -- Copyright (c) 2023 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>
- `decode-named-character-reference`, `micromark-core-commonmark`, `micromark-factory-space`,
  `micromark-util-character`,

  (https://sindresorhus.com)
- `format` -- Copyright 2010 - 2014 Sami Samhuri <sami@samhuri.net> (from its `Readme.md`, which
  links the MIT licence, as do `format.js`' header and `package.json`. The 0.2.2 tarball carries no
  licence file; the upstream repository's `License.md`, added later, is MIT from the same holder)
